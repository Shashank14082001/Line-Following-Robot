# Line-Following-Robot
The objective of a line-following robot using Arduino and sensors is to design and implement an autonomous robotic system that can follow a predefined path marked by a visible line on a surface. The use of Arduino microcontroller and sensors, such as infrared or reflective sensors, allows the robot to detect the contrast between the line and its surroundings.
